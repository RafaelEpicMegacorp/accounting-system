# Task: Authentication System Implementation

## Status: IN PROGRESS
**Created**: 2025-01-24  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Phase**: 2A - Authentication Foundation  

## Objective
Build a complete JWT-based authentication system with user management, secure login/logout, and protected routes for both backend and frontend.

## Subtasks

### ✅ BACKEND COMPLETED
- [x] Create authentication middleware for Express with JWT
- [x] Build user registration API endpoint
- [x] Build user login API endpoint
- [x] Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Create protected route middleware
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization
- [x] Create user profile management endpoints
- [x] Build logout/token invalidation
- [ ] Add password reset functionality (email-based) *future enhancement*

### ✅ FRONTEND COMPLETED  
- [x] Create React authentication context
- [x] Build login form with validation
- [x] Create registration form
- [x] Implement protected route components
- [x] Add user session persistence (localStorage)
- [x] Create logout functionality
- [ ] Build user profile management UI *pending*
- [x] Add loading states and error handling

### ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETED
- [x] Connect frontend auth context to backend APIs
- [x] Add proper error messages and user feedback
- [x] Add authentication state management
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow *in progress*
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism *future enhancement*

## Requirements from accounting.md

### User Management (Lines 222-230)
- [x] User authentication infrastructure
  - [ ] Login/logout functionality
  - [ ] Password reset via email  
  - [ ] Session management
- [ ] User roles (future enhancement)
  - [ ] Admin - full access
  - [ ] Viewer - read-only access
  - [ ] Billing - invoice management only

### Security Requirements (Lines 276-283)
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware ← **Current Focus**
- [x] Add rate limiting to API endpoints ✅
- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Technical Implementation

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "userId": "user_id",
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "iat": "issued_at_timestamp",
  "exp": "expiration_timestamp"
}
```

### API Endpoints to Create
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation

### Middleware Functions
- `authenticateToken()` - Verify JWT token
- `requireAuth()` - Protect routes requiring authentication
- `validateInput()` - Sanitize and validate user inputs

## Security Considerations
- Use bcrypt with salt rounds ≥ 12 for password hashing
- JWT tokens expire in 24 hours
- Implement refresh token mechanism
- Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies for web)
- Add rate limiting to auth endpoints (stricter than general API)
- Validate all user inputs against injection attacks
- Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can login and receive valid JWT tokens
- [ ] Protected routes reject unauthorized requests
- [ ] Frontend auth context manages user state
- [ ] Login form works with proper validation
- [ ] User sessions persist across browser refreshes
- [ ] Logout clears user session and tokens
- [ ] All auth flows have proper error handling

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Begin Client Management System (Task 03)
2. Apply authentication to all future API endpoints
3. Add user role-based permissions (future phase)
4. Implement password strength requirements
5. Add two-factor authentication (future enhancement)

## Notes
- Using existing JWT and bcrypt dependencies already installed
- Database User model already created in Prisma schema
- Frontend login page component already scaffolded
- Will integrate with existing Express server and security middleware
