## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Material-UI over Chakra/Radix:** Chose MUI for comprehensive component library and enterprise features
- **Framer Motion over React Spring:** Better TypeScript support and simpler API
- **React-PDF over jsPDF:** JSX-like syntax matches our React development approach

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Foundation first:** Establish design system before building features
2. **Mobile-first approach:** Design for mobile then enhance for desktop
3. **Accessibility built-in:** WCAG compliance from the start, not retrofitted
4. **Performance by design:** Code splitting and optimization planned from beginning

### Future Considerations
- **AI-powered features:** Prepare architecture for ML-based automation
- **Real-time collaboration:** Design components for multi-user scenarios
- **Global accessibility:** Plan for international expansion with i18n support
