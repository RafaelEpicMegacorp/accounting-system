## Requirements from accounting.md

### Client Database (Lines 39-48)
- [ ] Implement client CRUD operations ← **Current Focus**
  - [ ] POST /api/clients - Create new client
  - [ ] GET /api/clients - List all clients with pagination
  - [ ] GET /api/clients/:id - Get single client details
  - [ ] PUT /api/clients/:id - Update client information
  - [ ] DELETE /api/clients/:id - Soft delete client
- [ ] Add client validation
  - [ ] Email format validation
  - [x] Required fields: name, email ✅
  - [x] Unique email constraint ✅
- [ ] Create client management UI
  - [ ] Client list page with search/filter
  - [ ] Client creation form
  - [ ] Client edit form
  - [ ] Client detail view showing related orders

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints to Create
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `GET /api/clients` - List clients with pagination, search, filters
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get single client with related data
- `PUT /api/clients/:id` - Update client information
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Soft delete client
- `GET /api/clients/:id/orders` - Get client's orders
- `GET /api/clients/search` - Search clients by name/email

### Database Operations
- Client creation with validation
- Client updates with audit trail
- Soft delete (mark as inactive)
- Search and filtering queries
- Pagination with efficient counting
- Related data loading (orders, invoices)

### Frontend Components
- `ClientList` - Main client listing with search/pagination
- `ClientForm` - Create/edit client form
- `ClientCard` - Individual client display
- `ClientDetail` - Full client information view
- `ClientSearch` - Search and filter controls
- `ClientPagination` - Pagination controls

### Validation Rules
- **Name**: Required, 2-100 characters, letters/spaces/hyphens only
- **Email**: Required, valid format, unique across system
- **Company**: Optional, max 100 characters
- **Phone**: Optional, valid phone format
- **Address**: Optional, max 500 characters

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All client CRUD operations working with authentication
- [ ] Client list displays with search and pagination
- [ ] Client creation form validates and saves correctly
- [ ] Client editing preserves data integrity
- [ ] Client deletion is soft delete with confirmation
- [ ] Search finds clients by name, email, or company
- [ ] Pagination handles large client lists efficiently
- [ ] All operations have proper error handling
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback for all actions

## Security Considerations
- All endpoints protected by authentication middleware
- Input validation and sanitization on all client data
- User can only access their own clients (future: multi-tenant)
- Soft delete preserves data for audit purposes
- Rate limiting on search endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM

## Performance Requirements
- Client list loads in <2 seconds for 1000+ clients
- Search results return in <500ms
- Pagination loads instantly
- Form validation is real-time
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Begin Order Management System (Task 04)
2. Connect clients to order creation workflows
3. Add client reporting and statistics
4. Implement client import/export functionality
5. Add client communication history tracking

## Notes
- Client model already exists in Prisma schema ✅
- Authentication system is ready for protection ✅
- Validation utilities already created ✅
- UI components will follow Material-UI patterns ✅
